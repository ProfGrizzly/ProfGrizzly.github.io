## Hi there! This is a test to figure out how to create my own webpage using a github repository!

Click [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) to see the how I did that.

Everytime I commit to this repository Jekyll will generate a new webpage.
Additional pages can be added by creating or pushing folders to this repository.
Hope it works!
